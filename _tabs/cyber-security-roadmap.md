## Starting The Journey

### Computer Fundamentals
- CompTIA A+
- Only if you have no idea about computers. This will teach very basics. Good to learn, but skip if you have been using computers.

### Operating Systems
- Windows OS: Learn about different OS from Microsoft, their versions, and improvements over last versions (broadly). Just get around with day-to-day tasks in Windows OS, and very basic troubleshooting.
- Linux OS and Uses, different distributions: What is Linux, what are Linux Distros/Distributions, what is Linux Kernel and its functions, different Linux distributions idea, what's the basic difference in Linux Distributions.

### The Best OS for Hackers
NEVER! NEVER get into this debate. OS does not make better Hackers. A hacker is who can do his task on any OS, Windows or Linux all work equally well for most of the tasks.

### GOOGLE: Learning How to do Google Search like Hackers
Searching/Research is what can really make someone a Hacker; it is the most important skill. Search anything on search engines. Facing any problem? "How to <problem>" search this and you can get the solutions 99% of the times.

### Learn What is Cyber Security / Hacking / Penetration Testing / Blue Teaming / Red Teaming / Different Cyber Security Domains (Jobs)
Search and learn about:
- What is Cyber Security
- What is Hacking
- Why do we need Cyber Security
- What Hackers do
- What are jobs in Cyber Security
- What all Skills are needed to get a job in Cyber Security

## CURIOSITY | RESEARCH | PATIENCE
Always try to Know more about things. To break things efficiently, some knowledge of How to make things is better to have.

## Towards Basic Knowledge of Security & Hacking

### Computer Programming (Start basics)
Start with any 1 or two languages and give at least 20 hours to learn. It may be Python, JavaScript, or any other.

Is programming really necessary for hacking? NO. But do you want to be a good hacker without knowing or understanding basic programming? Very rare chances.
